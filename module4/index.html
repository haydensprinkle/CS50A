    <main>
      <h3>Evolution</h3>
      <p>
        Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini. Like other
        strepsirrhine primates, such as lorises, pottos, and galagos, they share
        ancestral (or plesiomorphic) traits with early primates. In this regard,
        lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates; however, lemurs
        did not give rise to monkeys and apes (simians). Instead, they evolved
        independently in isolation on Madagascar.

      <h3>Behavior</h3>
      <p>
        Lemur behaviour is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet,
        social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator
        avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels help define
        lemur taxa and set individual species apart from the rest. Although
        trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the
        larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify
        the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.
      </p>

      <h3>Ecology</h3>
      <p>
        Madagascar not only contains two radically different climatic zones, the
        rainforests of the east and the dry regions of the west, but also swings
        from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic and
        geographical challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity,
        wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting
        trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense
        morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the
        ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.
      </p>

      <h3>Conservation</h3>
      <p>
        Lemurs are threatened by a host of environmental problems, including
        deforestation, hunting for bushmeat, live capture for the exotic pet
        trade, and climate change. All species are listed by CITES on Appendix
        I, which prohibits trade of specimens or parts, except for scientific
        purposes. As of 2005, the International Union for Conservation of Nature
        (IUCN) listed 16% of all lemur species as critically endangered, 23% as
        endangered, 25% as vulnerable, 28% as "data deficient", and only 8% as
        least concern.
